# Command Line Basics Exercise

-   Make a new folder named "Animals"
-   Inside of "Animals" add 2 directories: "AwesomeAnimals" and "SketchyAnimals"
-   Inside of "AwesomeAnimals" add the following files: "Capybara.js", "ArcticFox.html", and "TreeFrog.txt"
-   Inside of "SketchyAnimals" create a "Snakes" directory. Snakes are extra sketchy.
-   Inside of the "Snakes" directory create the following files: "Cobra.css" and "ReticulatedPython.py"
-   You have a change of heart and decide that Bullet Ants are no longer sketchy. Remove the "BulletAnt.js" file
-   All animal life goes extinct. Delete the entire "Animals" directory.

The solution to the last two problems are: rm Animals/SketchyAnimals/BulletAnts.js and rm -rf Animals
